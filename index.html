  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>
    At Cherub, agents are highly trained, extremely talented, and all under the age of 18.
    They are used for spying on terrorists, hacking into classified documents, and help resolve any problems
   that have a threat of killing ctizens.
  </p>
  <h2>Founders</h2>

  <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
  <p>
    Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
      Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
    <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
    introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
    <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
    plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
    are slightly exaggerated.
  </p>
  <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
  <p>
    When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
    on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
    interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
    interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
  </p>
  <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
  <p>
    You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
    Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
    at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
    tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
